<-------------------------------------- key learning from lacture 4 ----------------------------------------------------->

now from thsi lacture we are going to make a food ordering Aap
Always first make a structing what you are going to build

we should have only one parent element in functional component but if we want to use multiple parent component we can use React.fragment

there are two way of using it
1. <React.fragment></React.fragment>
2.<></>
we need to put our code inside this

how to give style inside my react

cosnt styleobj={
    background-color=black
}
const jsx=()=>{
    <h1 stile={styleobj}></h1>
}

if there is array then we have to use .join(",")


whatever we passes as an attribute it is known a s props (property)

we can destructure ove fly

... Es 6 spread operator
in functional programming we don't use for loop we use map
map is the best way to do functional programming

we make our site using config driven api

----------------------------------------<virtual dom ---------------------------------------------------

virtual dom is representation of actual dom
virtual dom is software engineering conscept which we use it multiple places
virtual dom used diff algorithm
we need virtual dom for reconciliation
it tell what need to change what need not to
React uses key for diff algorithm
 so it compulsory to pass key 
 if we don't use key then react willl rerender everything


virtual dom ques
1. what is virtual dom
2. what is reconciliation
3. what is diff algorithm
4. why we use key
5. what is React .fragment
6. what are the type of components
7. what is use of babael
8.syntax of functional component,
9. syntax of React Elament
10. what is config driven ui
11.how to render one functional component into other functional component
12. can there be multiple parent in functional component
13. what is spread operator in Es6 and what is the use of it
14. what react fibre in react 16
15 what is map and how we use it







It is not recommended to use the index of the array as the key prop if you know the array will not be static. If the key is an index, reordering an item in the array changes it. Then React will get confused and re-render the incorrect element
