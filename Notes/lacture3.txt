 lacture 3 key points 
 in this lacture we will going to learn about jsx (javascript Xml )
  Polyfill: A code is replacement that a replacement for a new version of code 
   there is replacement code that is compatable with older version it babel that do it

   babael is just a javascript package it is taking some and give some other code
Tree Shaking : Remove unwanted code (parcel done this)
parcel remove all the unwantedcode

Parcel also remove console.log()
we have configured our project for that we use "babel pluin transform remove console"
 --save-dev ==== -D
if there are multiple child so to distuingh we use keys so that it will be easy for react
rander: updating something in dom
React.createElement is creang an object which is then converted to html/dom
//jsx syntax
cosnt heading= <h1 id ="" key ="" >  </h1>
above one is not a sting and 
react track uniquness using key
jsx is not html inside javascript 
jsx is fancy way for writing html
jsx uses React.createElement behind the scene

Babel comes with parcel

Every thing in react is a componenets
navbar is componeent footer header body cards every thing is components

there are two type of f components
1.. functional componenets
2. class Based componenets

function componenet is nothing but a components
it return some pieace og jsx
 Arrow function
cosnt header =()=>{

   return  (
      <h1> functional react component</h1>
   )

}
if there are multiple line in functional components then we have wrap it up in ()
it is not compulsory to write return in functional componenets
// normal function
cosnt header=function(){

}
 if we have render functional component inside functional component then
 <nameofElement />
 {nameofreactElament}
 {nameofcomponenet()}

 React prevent from cross xml attck

 sanitization

 componennt composition when
